1. How can we design the system in a way
    that every Company will be able to serve games
    on their gaming site from their domain?

- There are 2 approaches:
  a) separate deployment per each site/client
  b) single cluster for all sites; introduce scopes

`a` is hard to support, if there are a lot of sites.

`b` needs to scope
  - the users
  - leaderboards
  - sub-set of the games per site from the common pool of games

There should be standard tutorial how to iframe the game(s) into custom site of the client.
Or we can implement/host some standard with custom client Logo/colors on subdomain.


2. What modification should be done to the users table at gPlatform to support this change?

- users table should have siteId FK.
- It refs. to sites table.


3. Considering we have 1 backend cluster that serves all companies,
    how can we validate a user login on one gaming domain in such a way
    that it does not give access to a different gaming domain?
    (i.e. authenticating on site A, grants access to site A only)

- The token is the result of authentication process. It has siteId field in its payload.
- Authorization scopes the access to objects/functions in terms of specific siteId only.


Note:
    In some cases,
    It would be helpful to share players from another site in gameplay only,
    if there are not enough players on the new site.
